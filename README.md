# Hi there 👋

## 🤓 About Me
I'm a husband and father of four, currently working as a security consultant. I've really only started developing tools to make my life a little bit easier, but I hope to be able to develop them into useful tools for the INFOSEC community. 

## 🔭 Current Projects
I'm working on a couple of tools to help with pentest reporting:
- A tool to parse `nmap` output, consolidate hostnames by IP address, and count the total number of listening services by port across all hosts. 
- Another tool to parse Dehashed output (breached credentials) and organize usernames, passwords, hashes, and breach information under each affected user. 

## ⚡️ Current Learning
I'm currently working on getting better at Web Application Testing and Security. Hopefully more tools to follow in that space.
