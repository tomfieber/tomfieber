# Hi there 👋

## 🤓 About Me
I'm a husband and father of four, currently working as a security consultant. I've really only started developing tools to make my life a little bit easier, but I hope to be able to develop them into useful tools for the INFOSEC community. 

## 🔭 Current Projects
I'm working on a couple of tools to help with pentest reporting:
- An appendix generator that takes in multiple nmap XML and dehashed json files and exports tables of IP-Hostname mapping, listening services, and breached credentials tables. 
- A tool to automate some of the repetetive enumeration for every engagement (i.e., hostname enumeration and breach searching)

## ⚡️ Current Learning
I'm currently working on getting better at Web Application Testing and Security, as well as Python development. Hopefully more tools to follow in that space.
